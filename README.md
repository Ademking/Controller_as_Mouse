# Controller_as_Mouse
Control the mouse using Game Controller - Having fun with Pyhton -

I want to use my old game controller as a Mouse. That's why i wrote this tiny script in Python
I thought this is the best way to practice coding in Python... 

You can :
* Move the mouse and interact with the desktop (__Using control stick__)
* Scroll through pages
* ALT + TAB between apps (my favourite shortcut)
* Change the mouse speed

# How to run

1. install requirements

`pip install -r requirements.txt`

2. run script

`python app.py`
